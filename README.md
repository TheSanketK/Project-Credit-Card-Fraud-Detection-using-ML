# Project-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML
In credit card fraud detection using machine learning, main motive is to differentiate the transaction into fraudulent transaction and legit transaction.
for that firstly i've pre-prosessed data, check if there is any null values, after that i've diffrentiated fraud transactions and legit transactions. then i've
took same amount of legit transactions as fraud transactions and concated both in single set.
later i've trained that new dataset using logistic regression to get better results.
